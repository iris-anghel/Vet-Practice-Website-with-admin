# vet-practise
	This is a website for a veterinary practise (in Romanian).
	It includes a section for data management. 
    After the vet is logged in, he can add, edit, delete and list his pacients and owners.

    TODO:
        - fix foreign key problem;
        - add other tables with prescriptions, treatments etc;
        - add pagination when table results > 10;
        - maybe add more validation;
        - definitely add more styling and interactivity;
